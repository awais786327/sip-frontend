# Getting started

1. Go to project folder and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Launch development server, and open `localhost:4200` in your browser:

```bash
npm start
```

```

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.
You should not use `ng serve` directly, as it does not use the backend proxy configuration by default.

# What's in the box

The app template is based on [HTML5](http://whatwg.org/html), [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) and
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com). The translation files use the common [JSON](http://www.json.org) format.

#### Tools

Development, build and quality processes are based on [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and
[NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), which includes:

- Optimized build and bundling process with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io)
- [Development server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) with backend proxy and live reload
- Cross-browser CSS with [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) and
  [browserslist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist)
- Asset revisioning for [better cache management](https://webpack.github.io/docs/long-term-caching.html)
- Unit tests using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io) and [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io)
- End-to-end tests using [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor)
- Static code analysis: [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint), [Codelyzer](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer),
  [Stylelint](http://stylelint.io) and [HTMLHint](http://htmlhint.com/)
- Local knowledgebase server using [Hads](https://github.com/sinedied/hads)
- Automatic code formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
